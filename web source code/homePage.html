	<h1>Welcome to the Hogwarts Database</h1>
	<h2>CS 340 Final Project</h2>
	<h3>A database driven website using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL</h3>
	<br>
	<p>This was my final project for CS 340 (Introduction to Databases) at OSU, which required a database 
	with at least 4 entities and 4 relationships, one of which was to be a many-to-many relationship. 
	All source code
	is available on my GitHup repository <a href="https://github.com/kylepj/web-database">here</a>.
	</p>
	<br><br>
	<h3>Project Contents:</h3>
	<h4>The Basics: Adding data to entity/relationship tables:</h4>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="addBlood.php">Student Blood Status</a>
		<li><a href="houses.php">Hogwart's Houses</a>
		<li><a href="subjects.php">Hogwart's Subjects </a>
		<li><a href="teachers.php">Hogwart's Teachers</a>
